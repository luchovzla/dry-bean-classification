# Machine Learning Final Project - University of Minnesota Data Analytics Bootcamp - 2021 Cohort


The purpose of this project is to showcase our machine learning skills using the SciKit-Learn library and the various classification and regression algorithms that it provides. 

We analyzed the Dry Bean Dataset from the University of California - Irvine Repository ([UCI Dry Bean Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset#)). This data set includes 13,611 entries containing 16 attributes, resulting in 7 possible   
bean classifications. We determined that all 16 of the attributes were relevant, which meant minimal clean-up was required to the data set allowing us to quickly begin our machine learning analyses.

We used the following classifications and regressions to make our predictions: K-Nearest Neighbors, Multiple Linear Regression, Neural Networks and Random Forest. 

Our team members included Joe Raasch, Luis Gomez, Roberto Pupo and Terra Vaughn.
